# Images
This folder hosts images and [draw.io](www.draw.io) XML specs that I have designed and used to respresent concepts in presentations and blogs

## To modify an existing image
1. Clone this repository
2. Open [draw.io](www.draw.io) in your browser
3. Choose "Device" and then use the "Open Existing Diagram" option
4. Point to the xml file corresponding to the image you would like to edit
5. Save the xml file with your changes & enjoy
6. Would be great if you could contribute it back to this repo :-)
